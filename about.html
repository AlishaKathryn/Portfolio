      <p>When I was a child, I wanted to be a writer. (Okay, actually, I wanted to be a mermaid. But writer came in as a close second.) I wrote my first story when I was five, a dramatic retelling of the Easter Bunny's story, typed on my dad's Smith Corona.</p>
      <p>(Yes, a typewriter.)</p>
      <p>I've always been fascinated by the ways we craft stories. I took this early curiosity and began my career by studying English & Creative Writing, learning what goes into a good story and how to create one. My career took me to study and write in Oxford, England. Since then, my work has been published in anthologies and journals around the world.</p>
      <p>But writing wasn’t enough. I wanted to tell stories through more than just words. In 2017, I taught myself photography, and then Photoshop. I fell in love with the interplay of visual and written narrative, and soon became fascinated with strong design. I began noticing the brands that caught my eye, and became curious about why they did so. I dug my heels in, studied an immersive Product Design program, and became a UX Designer.</p>
      <h1>— And what I realized is this: good design tells a story.</h1>

      <p>Good design tells the story of us: who we are, what we do, and what we offer the world. Through my work, I continue to come back to the essential things that drive me: the profoundness of well-crafted narrative, the captivating nature of visual language, and the beauty of strong design. What underpins my work is the ability to uncover the unique essence of a brand, product, or service, understand what sets it apart, and translate that into design.</p>
      <p>My foundations as a writer has instilled the importance of clear communication, my interest in gorgeous visuals has ensured the things I create are aesthetically appealing, and my innate empathy and curiosity has driven me to create designs and brands that users will want to engage in.</p>
      <p>When I’m not crafting stories, you can find me eating vegan food, strolling along Philadelphia’s cobblestone, riding my bike, or seeking out the best vintage clothes in West Hollywood.</p>
